# Welcome


This Swift Stellar SDK helps iOS and macOS developers to interact with the Stellar Blockchain and its Ecosystem. 

The SDK has three main uses: 

- It helps you to query the blockchain by using the Horizon endpoints provided by Stellar.
- It helps you to build, sign and submit transactions to the Stellar Network.
- It helps you to interact with the Stellar Ecosystem (e.g. Anchors), by providing implementations of different [Stellar Ecosystem Proposals](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem).

The goal of this documentation is to provide you knowledge of how to use the different functions of SDK in your app. 

Before you start, please familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of Stellar. Take a look at the [Stellar developer site](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/).

We also recommend that you use the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/) tools while learning to implement applications that access the Stellar Network. It provides a set of tools that enables you to try out and learn about the Stellar Network. With the laboratory you can manually build transactions, sign them, and submit them to the network via the browser. It can also make requests to any of the Horizon endpoints.


## Documentation content

We have structured the documentation in such a way that it starts with the basics and builds on this to cover the more advanced topics. Of course, it can also be used as a reference work. 

Many of the source code examples from the documentation can also be found as [test cases](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/tree/master/stellarsdk/stellarsdkTests) in the source code of the SDK. If you don't find what you search for in this documentation, we recommend you to also look for it in the [test cases](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk/tree/master/stellarsdk/stellarsdkTests), because they cover the whole functionality of the SDK.
